### Hey!

I'm Felix, a developer from Berlin interested in user interfaces, music and microcontrollers.

I'm currently working on real-time conversation analysis at [Unique](https://www.unique.ch). After hours, I'm volunteering with [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) to build open-source tools for OSINT researchers.
